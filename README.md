Ice Skating Club Sign-In App
I built this using Flask and SQLAlchemy. It helps the ice skating club keep track of member sign-ins for weekly meetings, track attendance for specific meetings, and manage overall attendance records.

Member Sign-In:
Allows members to sign in with their names.
Automatically records the date and time of the sign-in.

Meeting Management:
Admins can create meetings with specific dates, times, and topics.
Tracks which members attended each meeting.

Attendance Dashboard:
Displays overall attendance for each member.
Displays a breakdown of attendees for each meeting.


Installation Prerequisites
